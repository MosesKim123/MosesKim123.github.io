        <p>I like this image because it is so simple yet it delivers probably the most clear answer you can give
            message
        </p>

        <img src="images/noImage.png" height="500">
        <p> I like this image because i sort of humors me how you can completly deny someone with one two letter
            word.

        <p> i chose a can of pepsi because i think pepsi cans have the best can colour out of other cans. I
            really like
            the
            blue on the backgroung of an pepsi can</p>

        <p>skiing is my favourite sport so i included the picture in here. i am itching to go skiing
            once there is

        <p>All i want is a computer to play games on. I am right now using a 2 year old windows
            surface for all my games
            and
            it is depressing.</p>
